                <p> BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy
                    band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. Originally a hip hop
                    group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wider range of genres. The septet—consisting
                    of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own
                    output. Their lyrics often discuss mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of
                    age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also frequently
                    references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
